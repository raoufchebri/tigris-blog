Earlier this year I started consolidating some workloads to my homelab
Kubernetes cluster. One of the last ones was a doozy. It's not a compute-hard or
a memory-hard workload, it's a storage-hard workload. I needed to move the DJ
set recording bot for an online radio station off of its current cloud and onto
my homelab, but I still wanted the benefits of the cloud such as no thinking
remote backups.

This bot has been running for a decade and the dataset well predates that, over
675 Gi of DJ sets, including ones that were thought to be lost media. Each of
these sets is a 320 KiB/sec MP3 file that is anywhere from 150 to 500 MB, with
smaller text files alongside them.

Needless to say, this dataset is very important to me. The community behind this
radio station is how I've met some of my closest friends. I want to make sure
that it's backed up and available for anyone that wants to go back and listen to
the older sets. I want to preserve these files and not just dump them in an
[Archive bucket](https://www.tigrisdata.com/docs/objects/tiers/) or something
that would make it hard or slow to access them. I want these to be easily
accessible to help preserve the work that goes into live music performances.

Here's how I did it and made it easy with Tigris.

## Storage in my homelab

:::note

For your convenience when reading, Kubernetes terms are written in GoPublicCase.
If you want to learn more about a Kubernetes term, I suggest searching for
`site:kubernetes.io TermNameHere`. All units are
[Kubernetes units](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/manage-resources-containers/#meaning-of-memory)
when possible.

:::

Kubernetes workloads are stateless by default. This lets you represent a lot of
valid services (it's kinda like Heroku by default), but many times you will need
persistent storage such as filesystem, relational, or object storage. In my
homelab cluster, I have two
[StorageClasses](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/storage-classes/):
NFS mounting folders from my NAS (via the
[nfs-subdir-external-provisioner](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/nfs-subdir-external-provisioner)),
and [Longhorn](https://longhorn.io). I ended up going object-storage native for
this project so that I didn't have to worry about exhausting the storage on my
homelab machines.

Most of my homelab projects use Longhorn for filesystem storage. Longhorn makes
it easy for me to not have to care about rebooting my homelab machines, and when
I do reboot one, it will automatically move volumes around so that they are
local to the machine running a given workload. I also configured Longhorn to
make nightly backups of all volumes to Tigris so that should my home get struck
by a meteor, I would still have all of my data. Every volume is distibuted
across three nodes, so random hardware failure is mathematically less likely to
cause me to have to restore data from a backup.

I can't use Longhorn for this because the PersistentVolumeClaim would need to be
at least one terabyte (1 Ti) and the primary SSD storage on each of my homelab
machines is one terabyte for both the OS and other volumes. This is too big. I
could add rotational drives to the mix in order to have more space (and I have
since I did this), but I didn't have any free drives at the time. This data is
also very infrequently accessed, so putting it on an SSD is overkill.

I could also put that data into my NAS via NFS, but I'd really feel better if
that data was automatically backed up to the cloud (or already in the cloud to
begin with). I could configure something to do that with a CronJob and a Tigris
access key, but that would require extra configuration and seems kinda hacky.
I'd really rather it be done by default or without extra configuration,
following the
[Charmin Ultra rule of infrastructure complexity](https://youtu.be/HjbfjCPuO2Y):
less is more. The thing you don't need to go out of your way to configure is the
thing that you will actually use.

I needed an option that would allow me to store the data in the cloud by default
without changing the application code too much. The bot is currently written
assuming that it's writing directly to a filesystem, kinda like most of the AI
tooling you'll find in the wild. I could change it to write to an S3 bucket, but
this bot was written before I believed Our Lord and Savior Unit Tests. I'd
rather not mess with it if I don't have to.

## Using S3 as a filesystem

What about S3 or [Tigris](https://tigrisdata.com)? If I could somehow mount a
bucket directly, I could store it in the cloud by default, making me not have to
maintain a copy of it locally. I did the math and it'd only cost me $16 per
month to have it all backed up. This is way cheaper than the 52€ per month I pay
for the server it's on right now.

I want this to be object-storage native so that I never have to think or worry
about this again. If I ever do have to worry about this again then I can just
give people presigned URLs when they try to access a DJ set.

I did some digging and found out about Yandex's
[csi-s3](https://github.com/yandex-cloud/k8s-csi-s3). It's a StorageClass
implementation that uses S3 buckets via
[geesefs](https://www.tigrisdata.com/docs/training/geesefs-linux/) as its
backing store instead of storage devices (rotational drives, SSD, EBS, etc.).
Unlike a lot of other StorageClass implementations I've tried this year, csi-s3
was really really easy to install. All I had to do was apply the release with
[helmfile](https://helmfile.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) and it was up:

```yaml
repositories:
  - name: csi-s3
    url: https://yandex-cloud.github.io/k8s-csi-s3/charts

releases:
  - name: csi-s3
    chart: csi-s3/csi-s3
    namespace: kube-system
    set:
      - name: "storageClass.name"
        value: "tigris"
      - name: "secret.accessKey"
        value: "tid_hunter2"
      - name: "secret.secretKey"
        value: "tsec_hunter2hunter2hunter2"
      - name: "secret.endpoint"
        value: "https://fly.storage.tigris.dev"
      - name: "secret.region"
        value: "auto"
```

I followed their
[test process](https://github.com/yandex-cloud/k8s-csi-s3?tab=readme-ov-file#4-test-the-s3-driver)
and then saw a `hello_world` file in the Tigris console in a dynamically created
bucket. Cool, it works!

:::note

Seriously, look at how short
[the csi-s3 guide](https://www.tigrisdata.com/docs/training/csi-s3/) is. It
would be shorter if I didn't inline the Kubernetes manifests!

## The migration

The next big step was migrating over all of the recordings. Since they were
"just files" on a Linux machine, I copied them over to my shellbox with
`rsync -avz`. It took a day or so to copy them all from Helsinki to Ottawa, but
that was okay.

Once that was done, I made a bucket (imaginatively named `pvfm`) and copied the
data over with `aws s3 sync`. I probably could have gotten better performance
out of [rclone](https://rclone.org/) or [s5cmd](https://github.com/peak/s5cmd)
(or if I copied the data to my NAS with its 2.5 gigabit NIC), but I started it,
went to sleep, and when I woke up it was done. When I looked back over the logs,
I noticed that the main reason why it took so long was that a lot of the older
files had many small files alongside of them (.cue sheets listing when each
track started and stopped in the DJ set). Tigris handles many small files
efficiently, but `aws s3 sync` didn't properly recycle HTTP connections so
uploading a small file was way more costly than it probably should have been.
Otherwise I was hitting the limits of the gigabit ethernet card in my shellbox.
Sweet!

Now that everything was in Tigris, I needed to put the bucket in Kubernetes as a
PersistentVolumeClaim. Normally when you create a PersistentVolumeClaim with the
`tigris` StorageClass, it creates a randomly named bucket. For example, let's
make a Tigris PersistentVolumeClaim:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
metadata:
  name: infinite-storage
  namespace: default
spec:
  accessModes:
  - ReadWriteMany
  - ReadWriteOnce
  resources:
    requests:
  	storage: 5Gi
  storageClassName: tigris
```

:::note

The storage request is ignored by csi-s3, but required for Kubernetes. I haven't
seen any consequences for using more storage than the PersistentVolumeClaim
requests, but your mileage may vary. If you're in doubt, just request 10
terabytes (`10Ti`) or something. This doesn't result in more storage use in
Tigris. You certainly won't regret requesting 10 terabytes for your bucket!

:::

However, when you do this, you end up creating a randomly named bucket. Even
though the PersistentVolumeClaim name is `infinite-storage`, the bucket will be
named something like `pvc-cbf58f8b-28d9-4d7d-8a1e-97e4e47b3c99`. This is also
the name of the PersistentVolume that backs the PersistentVolumeClaim.

So in order to create a PersistentVolumeClaim pointing at the `pvfm` bucket, I
needed to make both a PersistentVolume and the PersistentVolumeClaim at the same
time. This was fairly simple thanks to one of their examples, and I made
[a single config](https://github.com/Xe/x/blob/27eb123f7a4e3d1c94d297fb8706328a58a26acc/kube/alrest/pvfm/aura/pvc.yaml)
with both of them in it.

I created a test Pod and it worked instantly, all the files were there.

## The migration

Now that the data was moved over (including syncing over the other bits that
changed while the migration was happening), all that was left was to fully move
it to Kubernetes. I stopped the bot on the old server and then removed its DNS
record in Terraform. Once that was done, I started deploying the new manifests
while I wanted for the record to die from caches.

Applying the
[Deployment](https://github.com/Xe/x/blob/master/kube/alrest/pvfm/aura/deployment.yaml),
[Service](https://github.com/Xe/x/blob/master/kube/alrest/pvfm/aura/service.yaml),
and
[Ingress](https://github.com/Xe/x/blob/master/kube/alrest/pvfm/aura/ingress.yaml)
went off without a hitch. [cert-manager](https://cert-manager.io/) minted a new
certificate and [External DNS](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/external-dns)
set the DNS target for me. All that was left was to make sure it worked.

It worked on the first try. It still is up and working to this day with zero
issues. Most of the people using the bot are unaware that it's writing data to
Tigris and it allows Tigris to seamlessly fade into the background, while still
letting everyone benefit from the global distribution and near limitless storage
capacity.

## Having my cake and eating it too

I don't have to worry about the DJ set server running out of space anymore and I
have a lot more options when it comes to moving the bot around. It's just a Go
program talking to object storage via a filesystem. I can just sit back and let
it do its thing, all thanks to Tigris taking away the hard parts from me.

Here's all the things I don't have to care about anymore:

- Running out of disk space
- Having to run backups myself
- Having the bot go down when a single server goes down (Kubernetes will just
  reschedule it somewhere that isn't down)
- Having any special setup for the bot to run in another cluster (Kubernetes is
  Heroku 2, but even more flexible)

It Just Works™️, and that's such a relief. If you’re looking for a lightweight
way to manage persistent storage in Kubernetes without a ton of overhead, I’d
definitely recommend giving Tigris a shot.
