For incident responders, log search isn’t just a tool — it’s the clock ticking
down on containment. Every second waiting for a query is an extra second of
stress during an active incident. LogSeam is the security data lake house built
to turn massive log volumes into sub-second answers. Its AI-driven features add
another layer: autonomous agents that continuously scan logs for anomalies, and
natural-language threat hunting that makes querying intuitive. Faster queries,
plus smarter detection, net you faster response and fewer sleepless nights
doomscrolling your status page.

LogSeam searches through 500M+ logs/sec, exceeding 1.5+ terabytes/sec
throughput. Just drop files into a bucket, and the system handles the rest. No
patchwork of 15 services. No worries about scale or throughput. Deploy anywhere:
in LogSeam’s managed service or inside your own cloud.

## Faster Queries over Bigger Data

LogSeam builds a security data lake house for your logs, cutting through the
mass of ingestion and querying tooling to provide a simplified tool that does it
all. This single pane of glass lets you see what’s going on, add natural
language filters for your apps, and trace your complicated systems as threats
evolve. Every login attempt, API call, firewall hit, and user click gets
centralized in LogSeam so that you can stay ahead of issues before they happen.

All your historical data is hot, ready, and easy to search because storage is
scaled independently (and cheaply, due to object storage). If there’s a breach
or insider threat, you can go back and trace it in detail, not just hope your
logs weren’t already deleted. It’s a game-changer for compliance, fraud
detection, and AI-driven anomaly spotting. LogSeam provides provide per-tenant,
independently scaling compute layers to power fast queries, backed by a globally
distributed data lakehouse.

## The Architecture

As the CEO of LogSeam, Dan Wiley, describes, “When you’re doing log analysis,
you get small chunk files which are the **Achilles’ heel** of log file analysis.
What’s novel is we put the logs into the exact size file format, arranging and
compressing them, as we put them into Tigris. 50+TB of logs per day is no
problem. You don’t need 15+ services to ingest logs.”

On ingestion, LogSeam refactors your billions of JSON logs into efficient,
columnar Parquet files and applies Zstandard compression to cut log volume by
100x. This dramatically reduces storage size through compression and optimizes
logs for sequential scans, so queries run faster and at lower cost. Logs are
written into globally distributed storage, positioned close to where they’ll be
queried. The result: terabytes of history searchable in seconds.

When it’s time to search, LogSeam spins up elastic compute dedicated to each
query. Dozens or hundreds of nodes can each sustain multi-GB/s reads off the
backing object storage. Once the job is done, compute shuts down so cost maps
directly to usage. Analysts and AI agents never contend for resources, which
means consistent, predictable performance even during peak investigations.

Files are organized for sequential access and stored in Tigris, which keeps
small objects inline and keys ordered so sequential reads map to contiguous
storage blocks. The result is that query engines can coalesce millions of small
reads into large, efficient network operations. This is exactly what LogSeam’s
compute layer needs to sustain multi-GB/s per node.

## Global storage that’s actually global

Threats don’t respect geography, and neither should log search. When your
compute jobs are global, your logs are global too. LogSeam’s global replication
ensures an analyst in Sydney gets the same sub-second results as a peer in New
York, without cross-region delays or hidden costs.

When LogSeam needed a global object storage solution we looked far and wide. One day we found Tigris Data and what happened next was short of amazing. We found a Globally Performant Object Store that could scale with us, instead of working against us. We pushed over 1.5 TB/s (that's a big B) of search using 20 commodity compute engines searching over 500 Million logs per second....And all that with global replication and data protections.

Oh and they are just great to work with.

## Conclusion: Search, Unlimited

The result is a log search architecture that does not require trade-offs between
cost, speed, and scale. It eliminates the tangle of services traditionally
needed to make object storage viable for analytics, replacing it with a
streamlined path from ingestion to query.

For teams operating at scale — whether supporting Incident Response
investigations across continents or enabling AI-driven log analysis — LogSeam’s
design provides the performance headroom to keep up with the data you already
have, and the flexibility to handle what is coming next.
