One of the great things about modern AI editor workflows is how it makes it
easier to get started. Normally when you open a text editor, you have an empty
canvas and don‚Äôt know where to start. AI tools let you describe what you want
and help you get started doing it.

Today we‚Äôre happy to announce that we‚Äôre making it even easier to get started
with Tigris in your AI editor workflow. If you want to get to the part where you
can plug configs into your AI editor and get started, head to \<section link\>
and get off to vibe coding your next generation B2B SaaS as a service.

Abdullah just started at Tigris a week ago (Welcome\!) and has already built
something that will make it easier for you to make object storage a native part
of your development workflow: a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server for Tigris.
This enables you to manage your buckets in plain language in your AI capable
editor.

Just say ‚Äúmake me a bucket for this project‚Äù and it‚Äôll go do that. Want files in
the bucket? Just ask it to upload a file; it‚Äôll make it happen.

<div
  style={{
    height: "100%",
    width: "100%",
  }}
>
  <video
    id="attract-video"
    autoplay
    controls
    playsInline
    loop
    muted
    style={{
      width: "100%",
      height: "auto",
      maxWidth: "100%",
      maxHeight: "100%",
    }}
    onCanPlayThrough={(ev) => {
      ev.target.muted = true;
      ev.target.play();
    }}
  >
    <source
      src="/blog/img/blog/mcp-server/mcp-smol.mp4"
      type="video/mp4"
    />

Your browser doesn‚Äôt support the video element. Click on this instead:
[mcp-smol.mp4](/blog/img/blog/mcp-server/mcp-smol.mp4)

  </video>
  <script type="text/javascript" src="data:text/javascript,const v=document.getElementById('attract-video');setTimeout(async()=>{if(v.paused){await v.play();}},250);" />
</div>

## The vision

We want your developer experience with Tigris to be as seamless, unsurprising,
and natural as possible. What‚Äôs more natural than natural language? Getting this
set up was a breeze. Tigris is compatible with S3, so all Abdullah had to do was
glue S3 calls to the MCP library. Everything was already there, well-tested, and
ready to go. And it‚Äôs just object storage: there‚Äôs no chance you‚Äôll accidentally
spin up an expensive service and get a surprise bill.

Of note: many other MCP servers will try and do much more than they need to. Our
MCP server just does object storage. There‚Äôs no possibility of it spinning up
expensive servers and saddling you with a surprise bill with an unreasonable
number of zeroes in it.

## Getting started

To get started, create some
[access keys](https://console.tigris.dev/createaccesskey) and then install our
MCP server by adding this snippet to your `claude_desktop_config.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "tigris-mcp-server": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@tigrisdata/tigris-mcp-server", "run"],
      "env": {
        "AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID": "YOUR_AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID",
        "AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY": "YOUR_AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY",
        "TIGRIS_GLOBAL_ENDPOINT": "https://fly.storage.tigris.dev"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Then ask your editor to make you a bucket for a project and it will! More
instructions are on the official npm package
[here](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@tigrisdata/tigris-mcp-server).

## Trust

AI editors and tooling are really cool, but there‚Äôs some key things you should
be aware of before you blindly trust this. The Model Context Protocol ecosystem
is still very new, so there will almost certainly be problems we solve together
over time. There are also inherent risks involved in giving any tool access to
your cloud storage accounts or filesystem.

The Model Context Protocol server will run in the same level of sandboxing as
your editor does. Be careful with what you install and always double-check what
you run before you run it.

Additionally, AI tools are fundamentally built around random behavior and will
have unexpected results at times. Sometimes it takes the AI a couple tries to
learn what you want to do. Be very careful, as typos in an AI context can have
much more drastic consequences than they can in normal contexts. We don‚Äôt want
you to lose data you need. For example, when you run the `DeleteBucket` call,
you are _not allowed_ to do this unless the bucket has no data in it.

In order to be as transparent as possible, we‚Äôve made our Model Context Protocol
server [open source](https://github.com/tigrisdata/tigris-mcp-server) and are
actively monitoring that repository.

We‚Äôre making this as safe and reliable as possible. Part of this is the scope
reduction we mentioned earlier: we‚Äôre only managing your buckets. The other part
is by going out of our way to make this tool as boring as possible. Boring code
is easy to understand, easy to maintain, and easy to learn from. We hope that
this will help you make the exciting parts of your program while leaving the
boilerplate to machines.

We hope this will make using Tigris absolutely frictionless and that you can
learn how S3‚Äôs API works in the process. Not to mention, we want you to get out
there and build things!
