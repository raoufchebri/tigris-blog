Data migrations are risky. Data is sticky; once you put it somewhere, you need
to spend a lot of time, energy, and egress fees trying to move it somewhere
else. Let’s say you want to move all your data from The Big Cloud™ to another
cloud. The gold standard process usually goes something like this:

{/* truncate */}

1. Figure out every service that could be using object storage and identify
   which buckets they use
2. Group those buckets by access tier (Standard, Infrequent Access, Glacier,
   etc)
3. Copy over all the data in several rounds to be sure that everything is
   migrated
4. Shut down everything
5. Copy over any remaining data
6. Swap out access keys and configuration
7. Start everything up
8. Hope it works

This is a very stressful migration. It’s doable, but very very risky because
there’s little ability to fall back to your old storage provider. This risk is
usually so great that people (rightly) don’t want to even attempt to move object
storage providers. It’s too easy to accidentally lose data in the process.

Sure, you can do a blue green deployment, and test in lower environments. But
there’s almost always some legacy microservice, long forgotten but somehow in
the critical path. During a migration I led, there was a service with a monthly
job that delivered data to a customer. We only found out that service was never
migrated when the customer complained weeks after the migration. No one wants
this, and migrations don’t have to be a one way door.

At Tigris, we realize that this data inertia may make it hard for you to adopt
Tigris for your object storage needs. So we implemented
[Shadow bucket migration](https://www.tigrisdata.com/docs/migration/) to
eliminate many of the risks associated with migrating object storage providers.
When you set up shadow bucket migration, all the data on your old provider shows
up in Tigris like it was there in the first place. When you access the data from
Tigris, it gets copied over on demand.

Here’s what migrating to Tigris looks like:

1. Create new buckets
2. Enable shadow bucket migration with write-through
3. Move services over one at a time
4. If you encounter problems, revert them to the old object storage provider
5. Once everything is moved over and you feel confident, remove the shadow
   bucket configuration

We call this the “two way door” migration strategy.

### Migration Workflow Differences: Tigris vs other clouds

| -------------------------------------------: | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------: | :-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------: |
|                    **Incremental migration** |              ✅ Yes – built-in option to read and write to another cloud storage service during your migration.               |                     ❌ No native incremental migration tooling, you must implement that migration yourself.                     |
| **Read-through fallback to other providers** |                 ✅ Yes – Tigris can read from other storage providers if the object doesn’t exist in Tigris.                  |                                   ❌ No – you must ensure that the data is migrated yourself.                                   |
|                    **Write-through support** |                                ✅ Yes – Tigris can write new data to another storage provider.                                |                  ❌ No – you must implement dual writing (and the error handling involved with that) yourself.                  |
|                         **Backfill tooling** | Optional – you can backfill data from another provider to Tigris on your own schedule, shadow bucket migration buys you time. |                           Required – you must fully copy data over to that cloud before you cut over.                           |
|                        **Risk of data loss** |                                   Low – because of read-through and write-through support.                                    |                       Medium – data migrations are risky and services constantly write data to the cloud.                       |
|                         **Risk of downtime** |      Low – Tigris is globally distributed so even when a datacentre is lost you seamlessly get re-routed to another one.      | High – one phase of your data migration will require you to shut down services to copy over data, which is risky and expensive. |
|                     **Latency optimization** |   ✅ Tigris has multi-region object synchronization abilities so that data is always closest to your users as they need it.   |      ❌ Not always – some providers implement globally distributed object storage; but it is the exception, not the rule.       |

## Two Way Door Migration

When folks talk about an incremental migration between object storage providers,
they usually talk about migrating data in phases, either bucket by bucket or
service by service. There’s other strategies you can use like making your
application write data to both providers instead of one, or a read-through
strategy where data is moved as it’s accessed.

Tigris shadow bucket migration reads data from your old cloud storage service as
it’s accessed. If you enable
[write-through support](https://www.tigrisdata.com/docs/migration/#enable-data-migration-in-the-tigris-dashboard),
then any new data you write to Tigris seamlessly gets copied over to your old
cloud storage service. This means that you can revert should you need to.

This write-through option further reduces the risk of moving to another object
storage provider because undoubtedly you will forget about some long-untouched
workload that nobody has documented anywhere. Write-through makes sure that the
data keeps going to the old destination. This means that old workloads keep
getting new data and gives you enough time to track it down with audit logs.

### How it works

One of the best ways to think about Tigris is that it’s a multi-tiered cache
system. When a request comes in, the data is pulled from:

- SSD cache
- The local FoundationDB cluster
- The local regional block storage cluster
- Another regional block storage cluster in another region

If any one of those fails to contain the data, Tigris moves on to the next tier
of caching and tries again. If none of them succeed, Tigris returns a 404\.

When you enable shadow bucket migration, you add a fifth tier of caching: your
remote object storage service of choice. There’s additional niceties like
regularly listing objects to know what’s available, but that’s pretty much it.

## An example

Let’s say you have a bucket in Hetzner object storage. This bucket has over a
terabyte of old data, backups, and other important data that you want to migrate
over to Tigris. Here’s how you set up shadow bucket migration:

  style={{
    width: "100%",
    height: "auto",
    maxWidth: "100%",
    maxHeight: "100%",
  }}
>
  <source src="/blog/img/blog/shadow-bucket/demo.mp4" type="video/mp4" />
</video>

Create your bucket, punch your Hetzner object storage credentials into the
settings, hit save, then try and download things. It’s trivial. Everything moves
over on demand.

### Caveats

In order to have the best experience with shadow bucket migration, make sure to
do the following things:

- Make sure that your access credentials have the right IAM permissions for the
  buckets in your other cloud.
- Make sure that objects in the Glacier access tier have been restored from
  Glacier into standard.
- Make sure to take it easy, cloud migration can be stressful!

## Conclusion

We hope that this will make it easier for you to choose Tigris for your object
storage needs. Shadow bucket migration helps you overcome the data inertia
effect so that you can seamlessly upgrade your single-cloud data into becoming
multicloud data by default.
