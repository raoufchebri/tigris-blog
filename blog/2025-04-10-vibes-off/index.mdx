Let’s say you’re trying to work on a clone of Twitter to learn how something
like that is made with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/). Sooner or later, you’re
gonna hit a wall: someone wants to change their avatar. It's vibe coding time!

![Xe and Ty giving a high five](./high-five.jpg)

{/* truncate */}

In order to get off the ground quicker, you had your friends send you their
avatar images over a Discord DM, you put them in your avatars folder in your
project, and then asked
[the Tigris model context protocol (MCP) server](https://github.com/tigrisdata/tigris-mcp-server)
to upload them all to the bucket:

<Xe top>
Can you upload all of the avatars in public/avatars to my tigris bucket?
</Xe>
<Ty bottom>
Sure! I’ll help you upload them to your Tigris bucket. Let me break this down into steps:

First I’ll make sure that folder exists and if there’s anything in it. Then I’ll
upload each avatar file to your Tigris bucket named tigris-example (as specified
in your .env.local).

Let me start by checking the directory:

<MCPFileList
  title="Listed 3 items in public/avatars"
  files={[
    { name: "techlover.jpg", size: "3.1KB", date: "Apr 08, 01:26 PM" },
    { name: "janesmith.jpg", size: "3.6KB", date: "Apr 08, 01:26 PM" },
    { name: "nahtahul.jpg", size: "33.9KB", date: "Apr 08, 12:47 PM" },
  ]}
  defaultExpanded={false}
/>

Great! I found 3 avatar files in the directory. Now I'll upload each of these
files to your Tigris bucket. I'll use the same path structure as in your avatar
upload API route (`avatars/filename.jpg`):

<details>
  <summary>Multiple tool calls</summary>
  <MCPCall
    title={
      <>
        Called MCP tool <code>tigris_put_object_from_path</code>
      </>
    }
    parameters={{
      bucketName: "tigris-example",
      key: "avatars/techlover.jpg",
      path: "[project]/public/avatars/techlover.jpg",
    }}
    result={{
      ETag: "d41d8cd98f00b204e9800998ecf8427e",
      $metadata: {
        httpStatusCode: 200,
        attempts: 1,
      },
    }}
  />
  <MCPCall

    }}
    result={{

      $metadata: {
        httpStatusCode: 200,
        attempts: 1,
      },
    }}
  />
  <MCPCall

      $metadata: {
        httpStatusCode: 200,
        attempts: 1,
      },
    }}
  />
</details>

Perfect! I've successfully uploaded all three avatar files to your Tigris
bucket. Let me verify the uploads by listing the objects in the bucket:

<MCPCall
  title={
    <>
      Called MCP tool <code>tigris_list_objects</code>
    </>
  }
  parameters={{
    bucketName: "tigris-example",
  }}
  result={[
    "avatars/janesmith.jpg",
    "avatars/nahtahul.jpg",
    "avatars/techlover.jpg",
  ]}
/>

All three avatars have been successfully uploaded to your Tigris bucket
tigris-example under the avatars/ prefix. The files are:

1. `avatars/techlover.jpg`
2. `avatars/janesmith.jpg`
3. `avatars/nahtahul.jpg`

These files are now accessible through your bucket and can be used by your
application. Is there anything else you'd like me to help you with?

</Ty>

Let’s be real, sometimes you really do just need to do this and this genuinely
can help you get unstuck. But when you do, also make sure to ask for the command
to run yourself next time. This way you can learn without getting doomed to
training wheels.

<Xe top>
What command could I use for that next time?
</Xe>
<Ty bottom>
I'll show you how to use the AWS CLI to upload files to your Tigris bucket.Since Tigris uses an S3-compatible API, we can use the AWS CLI `s3` commands with the appropriate endpoint.

```
aws s3 cp public/avatars/ \
  s3://tigris-example/avatars/ \
  --recursive \
  --endpoint-url https://fly.storage.tigris.dev
```

Just make sure
[you've configured your AWS CLI](https://www.tigrisdata.com/docs/sdks/s3/aws-cli/)
to access Tigris!

</Ty>

This is a really great way to turn vibe coding sessions into lessons that you
can take with you for the rest of your career. Just be a little careful,
language models are really good at making very convincing looking text that is
about as false as birds being real. If you are not careful, you can end up
taking something as true when you _really should not_.

## When the vibe is off

In order to have better user empathy for people that do vibe coding, I had
Cursor kick off and go nuts implementing a lot of the boilerplate involved with
making a simple Twitter clone. I left it mostly alone while I was working on
something else. This worked out pretty well for me until I tried to generate an
avatar upload page.

Everything worked until I tried to upload an avatar:

```text
✔ Compiled /avatar/upload 200 in 978ms
✔ Compiled /api/avatar/upload in 218ms
✖ Error: A "use server" file can only export async functions, found string.
Read more: https://nextjs.org/docs/messages/invalid-use-server-value
at [project]/src/utils/storage.ts [app-route] (ecmascript) (.next/server/chunks/[root of the server]__decd23c8._.js:144:241)
at [project]/src/app/api/avatar/upload/route.ts [app-route] (ecmascript) (src/app/api/avatar/upload/route.ts:2:0)
at Object.<anonymous> (.next/server/app/api/avatar/upload/route.js:6:9)
```

So I took a look. `utils/storage.ts` seemed like a good place to start. It's
where Cursor put all the Tigris interactions. This code _should_ only ever run
on the server, so it got marked as
[`"use server";`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/data-fetching/server-actions-and-mutations).

When you make a file full of `"use server";` actions, it can't have anything in
it but async exported functions, but it found a string exported. I looked in the
file and instantly noticed what was wrong:

```js
export const bucket = process.env.TIGRIS_BUCKET || "tigris-example";
```

I’ve seen a few Next.js apps have “configuration variables” like this, this
pattern says “the bucket name is the contents of the environment variable
`TIGRIS_BUCKET`, but if that doesn’t exist, then use `tigris-example`. This lets
you have a different bucket in testing than you do in production. However, this
is a _string_, a _string_ is not an async function. The solution is to change
this to be an async function:

```javascript
export const bucket = async () => process.env.TIGRIS_BUCKET || "tigris-example";
```

When I asked the AI to come up with an option, it struggled for a bit and then
ended up wanting to make the file upload a _client_ component instead.

<Xe top>  
Hey how do I fix this error? \<paste\>  
</Xe>
<Ty bottom>  
Ah, I see the issue. The error is coming from your `storage.ts` file because you’re exporting objects in a server context. In Next.js 14, files used by server components can only export async functions when using `”use server”;`. Let’s restructure things in the storage utility to fix this:

```diff
-”use server”;
+”use client”;
[...]
 // Configure S3 client to use Tigris endpoint
 async function getS3Client() {
   return new S3Client({
     endpoint: "https://fly.storage.tigris.dev",
     region: "auto",
      credentials: {
-       accessKeyId: process.env.TIGRIS_ACCESS_KEY || 'dummy',
-       secretAccessKey: process.env.TIGRIS_SECRET_KEY || 'dummy'
+       accessKeyId: process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_TIGRIS_ACCESS_KEY || 'dummy',
+       secretAccessKey: process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_TIGRIS_SECRET_KEY || 'dummy'
      },
      forcePathStyle: false
   });
 }
```

You’ll need to update your environment variables to use the new names:

</Ty>

When I saw this, I had to do a double take. It left me thinking:

<Xe top bottom>
  Wait, hold up, that’s completely wrong. Why are you making the credentials
  public? Won’t that have massive implications on the integrity of those keys?
</Xe>

Next.js client components don’t have access to the environment variables your
server does. This is because many platforms
[use the environment to store configuration](https://12factor.net/config), and
leaking those to the client on every request would be _catastrophically bad_,
that is how you end up with all your customer information leaked on the dark
web.

However, sometimes there are “low risk” keys like heavily restricted API keys or
write-only API keys for things like browser telemetry. Those are okay to send to
the client.
[Next.js lets you send these variables to the client](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/configuring/environment-variables#bundling-environment-variables-for-the-browser),
but you have to go out of your way to do it by naming them `NEXT_PUBLIC_NAME`
instead of just `NAME`:

```text
SECRET_PLANS="save the world from itself"   # private, on the server
NEXT_PUBLIC_SECRET_PLANS="world domination" # public, on the client, everyone knows
```

Just so we’re clear: **DO NOT PUT YOUR TIGRIS CREDENTIALS IN ANY CODE EVER**,
use the secret management tools that are baked into your platform, they’re there
for a reason.

<Ty mood="coffee" top bottom>
  Doing that will make me a sad tiger.
</Ty>

## Can you spare me an `any`?

When I was later in the hacking process, I had CI/CD set up to a Kubernetes
cluster I had laying around. I pushed one of the avatar uploading changes and
noticed CI failed:

```text
13.10 ./src/components/FileUpload.tsx
13.10 7:31 Error: Unexpected any. Specify a different type. @typescript-eslint/no-explicit-any
13.10
13.10 info - Need to disable some ESLint rules? Learn more here: https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/config/eslint#disabling-rules
```

Looking at the bit in question (on line 7, near character 31):

```javascript
interface FileUploadProps {
  onUploadComplete?: (result: any) => void;
  onError?: (error: Error) => void;
  bucket?: string;
  keyPrefix?: string;
}
```

This is a pretty common pattern: a handler function that runs when something is
done. This callback is how you do lightweight message passing between components
(and to a limited extent, this is largely what code did way back in the day
before we had `async`, I remember the days of callback pyramids). But, we don’t
know what type the response is. In fact, we likely don’t care what type it is.
This `any` here says “I don’t care what type this is”.

However `any` is kind of a landmine waiting to happen. It’s okay in small doses,
but in general it’s a bad hammer to reach for. The solution here is to disable
the lint rule:

```diff
 interface FileUploadProps {
+  // eslint-disable-next-line @typescript-eslint/no-explicit-any
   onUploadComplete?: (result: any) => void;
   onError?: (error: Error) => void;
   bucket?: string;
   keyPrefix?: string;
 }
```

This makes things build and everything's okay. We can just put the fire over
with the other fire, it's all good, right?

![](./with-the-rest-of-the-fire.jpg)

Let’s see what the AI thought. It's been right before, so surely it'll be fine
this time, right?

<Xe top>  
How can I fix this error?  
</Xe>  
<Ty bottom>  
I can see this is a **Next.js** project with **TypeScript**.  
Let me check the `package.json` to see the build command and dependencies.

<MCPCall
  title={
    <>
      Called MCP tool <code>read_package_file</code>
    </>
  }
  parameters={{
    filePath: "package.json",
    lines: "1-200",
  }}
  result={{
    next: "15.2.4",
    react: "^19.0.0",
    "react-dom": "^19.0.0",
    tailwindcss: "^4",
    eslint: "^9",
  }}
/>

I notice a few potential issues that need to be addressed before building:

1. Some package versions seem incorrect or incompatible:

- **React 19** doesn't exist yet (latest is **18.x**)
- **Tailwind CSS v4** doesn't exist yet (latest is **3.x**)
- **ESLint v9** doesn't exist yet (latest is **8.x**)

Let me fix the `package.json` with correct versions:

<MCPCall
  title={
    <>
      Called MCP tool <code>update_package_file</code>
    </>
  }
  parameters={{
    filePath: "package.json",
    updates: [
      { dependency: "react", from: "^19.0.0", to: "^18.2.0" },
      { dependency: "react-dom", from: "^19.0.0", to: "^18.2.0" },
      { dependency: "tailwindcss", from: "^4", to: "^3.4.1" },
      { dependency: "eslint", from: "^9", to: "^8.56.0" },
    ],
  }}
  result={{
    success: true,
    updatedDependencies: ["react", "react-dom", "tailwindcss", "eslint"],
  }}
/>

After fixing these versions, your project should build correctly!

</Ty>

This is not the fix we wanted because
[React v19 does exist](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react). Additionally,
downgrading the version of React in a framework like Next.js is…catastrophically
bad.

Sure, vibe will help you get out the door and ship something, but be very
careful when you go out and just blindly accept what the language model says
without thinking carefully. Payday loans do get you more money, but if you’re
not careful the technical debt you rack up could cost you more than your project
would ever bring in.

Switching between vibing and debugging can be a bit of a struggle, but it's
necessary to check that the code you're generating doesn't have common errors.
Though you can't make big mistakes like deleting an entire bucket of objects
with the Tigris MCP server, your editor can still generate code that leaks keys
or doesn't handle the right types. I hope this example has helped you think
about how you verify the code after its generated.
