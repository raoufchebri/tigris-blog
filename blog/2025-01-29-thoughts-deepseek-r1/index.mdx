DeepSeek R1 is a mixture of experts reasoning frontier AI model; it was released
by DeepSeek on
[January 20th, 2025](https://api-docs.deepseek.com/news/news250120). Along with
the model being available by [DeepSeek's API](https://api-docs.deepseek.com/),
they released the
[model weights on HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1)
and [a paper about how they got it working](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12948).

DeepSeek R1 is a [Mixture of Experts](https://huggingface.co/blog/moe) model.
This means that instead of all of the model weights being trained and used at
the same time, the model is broken up into 256 "experts" that each handle
different aspects of the response. This doesn't mean that one "expert" is best
at philosophy, music, or other subjects; in practice one expert will end up
specializing with the special tokens (begin message, end message, role of
interlocutor, etc), another will specialize on punctuation, some will focus on
visual description words or verbs, and some can even focus on proper names or
numbers. The main advantage of a Mixture of Experts model is that it allows you
to get much better results with much less compute spent in training and at
inference time. There are some minor difficulties involved in making sure that
tokens get spread out between the experts in training, but it works out in the
end.

{/* truncate */}

DeepSeek R1 is a reasoning model. This means that the model generates a bunch of
"reasoning tokens" before it gives you an answer. These reasoning tokens are
effectively a scratch space where the model breaks down the problem, plans out a
solution, and then it ends its thinking and starts generating a response. This
is a very new workflow and it was originally spelled out in
[Learning to reason with LLMs](https://openai.com/index/learning-to-reason-with-llms/)
by OpenAI in September 2024\. This is an extension of
[Chain-of-Thought](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prompt_engineering#Chain-of-thought)
prompting as pioneered by the Google Brain team in 2022\.

Finally, DeepSeek R1 is a frontier-grade model, which means that the results are
really good. Specifically it means that the results of the model are almost as
good as the big closed models like Anthropic Claude, OpenAI's GPT and O line,
and Google's Gemini models.

So with all that terminology dumping out of the way, what does it look like?
It's very similar to other models, but there's an additional reasoning bit.
Here's an example:

<Conv name="Xe" profilePic={xe} top>
  How much wood could a woodchuck chuck if a woodchuck could chuck wood?
</Conv>
<Conv name="DeepSeek R1" profilePic={deepseekLogo} bottom>
<Reasoning timeTaken={45}>
Okay, so the question is "How much wood could a woodchuck chuck if a woodchuck could chuck wood?" Hmm, I know this is a classic tongue twister, but I wonder if there's a real answer to it. Let me think about it step by step.

First, I need to understand what's being asked. The phrase plays on the words
"woodchuck" and "chuck." A woodchuck is actually a type of rodent, also known as
a groundhog. They don't actually chuck wood, right? They dig burrows, but they
don't throw or move wood in any significant way. So the question is
hypothetical: if they could chuck wood, how much would they chuck?

The key here is that it's a playful riddle, so maybe there's a pun or a play on
words involved. Let me break down the words. "Woodchuck" – the name might come
from an Algonquian word, "wuchak," which is their name for the groundhog. But
the English reinterpretation led to "woodchuck," even though they don't chuck
wood. The verb "chuck" here means to throw or toss. So if a woodchuck had the
ability to throw wood, how much would it throw?

I remember hearing a possible answer that goes: "A woodchuck would chuck as much
wood as a woodchuck could chuck if a woodchuck could chuck wood." That's a
tautology, just repeating the question in the answer, but maybe there's a more
creative answer.

Alternatively, some people have tried to calculate it based on the animal's
physiology. Let me think. If a woodchuck could chuck wood, how much could it
realistically move? Considering their size and strength, maybe they could move a
certain amount per day. But since they don't actually do this, it's all
speculative.

Another angle is the alliteration and the tongue twister aspect. The original
question is meant to be tricky to say quickly. The answer might be more about
the wordplay than a literal quantity. For example, some answers use wordplay
with units of measurement, like cords of wood. A cord is a unit of volume for
firewood, so maybe the answer is a certain number of cords.

There's a study from wildlife specialists where they estimated how much dirt a
woodchuck can move when digging. Since they're related to chucking wood, maybe
someone extrapolated that. I recall that a woodchuck can move around 35 cubic
feet of dirt when digging a burrow. If we analogize that to wood, maybe they
could chuck a similar volume. But wood is denser than dirt, so the weight would
be different. But this is all hypothetical.

Alternatively, there's a humorous answer that references the tongue twister
itself. Like, "Enough to make the forest breathe heavily\!" or something like
that. But maybe the answer is more numerical. Let me check my memory. There's a
line in a song by Bobby Bare from 1963 called "The Mighty U.A." which says, "A
woodchuck would chuck 3.5 cords of wood if he could chuck wood." But I'm not
sure if that's a real reference or just part of the song.

Another approach is the phonetic one. The question sounds similar to "How much
wood would a woodchuck chuck..." which, when said fast, the "would a" and
"woodchuck" blend. Maybe the answer is in the repetition or the sound rather
than the actual quantity.

But if I have to give a literal answer, maybe I should consider the average
amount a similar-sized animal could move. For example, beavers cut down trees,
but they don't chuck the wood; they use it for building dams. A beaver can cut
down hundreds of trees a year. If a woodchuck had similar abilities, maybe it
could chuck a lot. But again, this is all speculative.

Alternatively, maybe the answer is zero because woodchucks can't chuck wood. But
the question says "if a woodchuck could chuck wood," so under that hypothetical
scenario, they can. So zero isn't the answer here.

Another angle is that the question is a riddle where the answer is a play on the
word "chuck." Maybe "chuck" here is a unit of measurement, but I don't think
that's the case. Or perhaps the answer is in the name: "woodchuck" – so "as much
wood as a woodchuck would," which is circular.

Wait, there's a study from the New York State Wildlife Service that supposedly
calculated it, but I think that's an urban legend. The supposed answer was 700
pounds, but that's likely made up. Still, it's a common answer people cite.

So, putting it all together, the answer is probably a humorous or nonsensical
one, playing on the tongue twister. The most common answers are either the
tautological one ("as much as he could") or a fictional number like 700 pounds
or 3.5 cords. Given that, maybe the best answer is the tongue-in-cheek one that
references the hypothetical scenario without a real-world basis.

</Reasoning>

The classic tongue twister "How much wood could a woodchuck chuck if a woodchuck
could chuck wood?" is a playful riddle rather than a literal question. Here’s a
breakdown of possible answers:

1. **Tautological Answer**: _"A woodchuck would chuck as much wood as a
   woodchuck could chuck if a woodchuck could chuck wood."_  
   This circular response leans into the wordplay and avoids quantification.
2. **Hypothetical Estimate**:  
   Some humorous calculations suggest a woodchuck might move **700 pounds** of
   wood (based on its burrowing strength) or **3.5 cords of wood** (a
   tongue-in-cheek reference from songs or folklore). These numbers lack
   scientific basis but add to the whimsy.
3. **Literal Reality Check**:  
   Woodchucks (groundhogs) don’t actually chuck wood—they dig dirt. If forced to
   guess, their hypothetical wood-chucking capacity might align with their
   burrowing output (\~35 cubic feet of dirt), but this is speculative.

**Final Answer**:  
The riddle has no definitive answer, but the most fitting reply leans into the
humor:  
_"A woodchuck would chuck all the wood it could... if it could chuck wood!
🌲😄"_

</Conv>

Note that there's two responses from the model: the text answer you're used to
seeing and the chain of thought that the model uses as "scratch space" to work
out the best answer.

## Why is DeepSeek R1 so good?

One of the big questions that people have is "if Chinese AI companies have to
deal with sanctions that limit their access to GPUs, why is one of the best
models from a Chinese AI company?" There's a reason why this is the case, but
it's not going to be super obvious from the outset.

Most of the time, people don't associate Nintendo with super-advanced high tech
4k HDR graphics technology. Their consoles are actually fairly underpowered and
require being clever with your optimizations. This is intentional because the
hardware design philosophy encourages lateral thinking with well-understood and
cheaply available technology. They buy a SoC and CPU and use the entire SoC and
CPU to make games in ways that no other company takes the time to do. When you
target a Nintendo platform, you have hard limits that you have to be clever
about in ways that you don't need to be when you target a PlayStation 5 or an
Xbox Series X. The PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X are just so powerful that you
can blow past all of the limits with ease.

Most western AI companies can just buy faster GPUs en masse. They have access to
the NVidia H100 (the most powerful flagship AI GPU) and can just purchase more
of them depending on their needs. They can create giant datacentres and stuff
them to the gills with as many GPUs as they want.

Chinese AI companies aren't so lucky. They have hard limits on how many GPUs
they can buy as well as what the limits of the cards are. I tried to dig up the
actual sanctions limits and I wasn't able to find clear guidance in the 300+
pages of legal text. However, DeepSeek says they train their models on a cluster
of NVidia H800 GPUs. The H800 has half the memory bandwidth of the H100. AI
workloads are mostly memory bandwidth bound. This is a near fatal flaw that
means that the DeepSeek team had to get clever.

The
[DeepSeek V3 paper](https://github.com/deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-V3/blob/main/DeepSeek_V3.pdf)
has a lot more details about how they managed to wring all the performance they
could from the cards they had, but here's the cliffsnotes:

- DeepSeek V3 (and R1) both use 256 experts and train 64 experts per node with 8
  nodes per group.
- They created their own training framework named HAI-LLM that dedicates some
  otherwise unused hardware for cross-node communication.
- They did all of their training using 8-bit floating point numbers so that they
  can get the most effectiveness per hour. Previously it was thought that 8 bit
  floating point numbers were too imprecise to handle AI training workloads for
  benchmark results like the ones DeepSeek achieved.
- They saved memory wherever possible in order to avoid costly cross-node
  communication and even more costly CPU to GPU memory copy calls.
- They used [Multi-Head Latent Attention](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04434) to
  further optimize memory usage to 5-13% of what would normally be required for
  this kind of training. This also allows them to cache inputs to the DeepSeek
  API, making them able to deliver the model cheaply through their platform.

If DeepSeek had unrestricted access to advanced GPUs, very few of these
efficiency advancements would need to be made. I was almost certain that we've
been leaving a bunch of overhead on the table with our use of GPUs, and DeepSeek
has confirmed it. I'm kinda surprised that the stock market reacted so violently
to this news though.

I suspect that one of the reasons that people think that DeepSeek R1 is so good
is that they're reading the reasoning / chain of thought output. One of the most
magic parts of ChatGPT's initial release in late 2022 was that you were able to
talk with a computer and have the computer talk back with you in plain English.
This anthropomorphized the computer (so that it's a "friend" or at least
authoritative-coded enough that you perceive it as a smart person). The
reasoning output of DeepSeek R1 is another place that you can see this kind of
subconscious anthropomorphization happening. I suspect that when you see it yap
away like:

<Conv name="DeepSeek R1 (thinking)" profilePic={deepseekLogo} top bottom>
  First, I need to revisit the original text and the previous rewrite. The
  original essay discusses the distinction between art and content, critiques AI
  tools for generating "slop," and emphasizes the importance of human
  creativity. The previous version by the assistant is structured with sections,
  uses bold for emphasis, and includes examples like Kasane Teto and Suno.ai.
</Conv>

That you subconsciously see that and start anthropomorphizing it because it
looks like the computer is "thinking" in the same way that you would take a
complicated problem or thought and break it down into smaller bits. It kinda
does make the model look adorable.

Personally, I think that when you evaluate the output of a reasoning model like
DeepSeek R1, you should **not** look at the reasoning before you look at the
answer to reduce your own bias.

There's also some controversy around
[DeepSeek R1 supposedly being trained on the output of OpenAI models](https://archive.is/KiSYM).
It's fairly common practice to use
[synthetic data](https://techcrunch.com/2024/12/24/the-promise-and-perils-of-synthetic-data/)
in AI training. This is also known as
[distillation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge_distillation), and is the
technique that DeepSeek used to make reasoning-distilled versions of Llama and
Qwen models
[as outlined in the DeepSeek R1 paper](https://github.com/deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1/blob/main/DeepSeek_R1.pdf)
(section 2.4).

Let's be real: most AI companies use data generated from OpenAI models, but not
in the way that you think. A lot of AI models are trained from webpages on the
internet. I personally have been having my own infrastructure struggle to cope
with the load of AI scraping operations causing immense load and being unable to
contact the operators of those bots to either give them the data they want
through an external means or to get them to stop assaulting my servers into
submission.

[AI slop](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AI_slop) has taken over The Internet.
Infinite shrimp Jesus can be churned out and overwhelms all human-authored
content. A project to
[track the word frequency that people use over the years](https://github.com/rspeer/wordfreq/blob/master/SUNSET.md)
has stopped collecting data because AI generated articles have overwhelmed
everything else. It seems we no longer have reliable word choice data from 2022
onwards. Even if you're not using OpenAI models directly, if you are scraping
the internet to get your training set, then you're still using OpenAI model
output. Period.

## DeepSeek's origins

DeepSeek is a research subsidiary of
[High-Flyer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-Flyer), a Chinese hedge fund and
quantitative trading firm. They are solely dedicated to making AI tools and
models better and have no dedicated plans for commercialization beyond selling
access to hosted copies of their models. This allows them to stay a pure
research organization and avoid
[the complicated maze of AI regulations in Mainland China](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/23/technology/deepseek-china-ai-chips.html?smid=fb-nytimes&smtyp=cur).

There's been a lot of fears that DeepSeek is some front for the Chinese
government in order to collect data through vague means that could have vague
impacts on people using their services. Usually people point to the terms of
service having concerning phrases like:

<Conv name="DeepSeek R1" profilePic={deepseekLogo} top bottom>
  By submitting [User-Generated Content], you hereby grant [Company Name] a
  non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free, sublicensable, and transferable
  license to host, store, reproduce, modify, publicly display, distribute, and
  otherwise use your [User-Generated Content] in connection with the operation,
  promotion, and improvement of the Service. This license persists indefinitely
  unless terminated by deletion of the [User-Generated Content] or account
  closure, subject to technical limitations and backups.
</Conv>

By accepting this agreement, you are saying that you allow the forum engine to
display your posts. Every time a major company changes their terms of service,
it becomes An Issue™️ and people are fearful that they gave the company they're
using to post to social media permission to distribute the things they post to
social media.

There's probably something to be said about the differences in legal regimes
between data hosted in the US and data hosted in Mainland China. Realistically,
if you use social media, you should expect the content you create on your device
to be distributed somewhere else.

## The model weights are open to the public

One of the ways that DeepSeek R1 stands out is that the model weights are
available to anyone
[on Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1). No
authentication or accepting of terms and conditions is required. Anyone can use
them as long as they comply with
[the license](https://huggingface.co/deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1/blob/main/LICENSE)
(MIT).

This is huge. This means that anyone can use a frontier-grade model on any
workflow they want with total privacy as long as they have enough hardware to be
able to run the model. This lets you have some of the most advanced AI
capabilities in places where you would never be able to run OpenAI or Anthropic
models.

All you need is anything from 192 gigabytes of ram on your Mac Studio to 1.2
terabytes of vram across multiple servers.

The fact that you can have the weights on your computer means that you can
fine-tune or [abliterate](https://huggingface.co/blog/mlabonne/abliteration) the
model so that you can customize it to the tasks you want to do. For example,
DeepSeek R1 lacks tool use, which limits its ability to fit into AI agent
workflows. I suspect that within a few weeks, we'll see fine-tuning to enable
tool use.

<Conv name="Xe" profilePic={xe} top bottom>
  Honestly the really cool part about DeepSeek R1 being open-weights means that
  people can just download it and finetune it for usecases like tool use. It
  lets the entire community not just use models, but contribute to making them
  better for everyone. It reminds me of a lot of the spirit and intent of open
  source software, but with AI models instead.
</Conv>

### The distilled models

Along with the main R1 model, DeepSeek published distilled versions of R1 based
on
[popular AI models](https://huggingface.co/collections/deepseek-ai/deepseek-r1-678e1e131c0169c0bc89728d).
This does demonstrate that training one model on the output of another works
well, at the risk of
[model collapse](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-024-07566-y) if this is
repeated too many times. Clearly this is effective in the short term and the
outputs of a model are public domain (copyright is usually restricted to human
authored output, there
[was a court case about a photograph taken by a monkey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monkey_selfie_copyright_dispute)).

## DeepSeek R1 is good enough for most people

AI companies have no moat. If a competitor comes in and gives people output that
is 95% as good as your model for 10% of the price, it's an easy decision to
switch. Nearly every AI company exposes their models using an API compatible
with the OpenAI API client, changing providers is as easy as changing out your
API key and the API endpoint.

Most of the time, you bill for AI model output per million output tokens (about
750,000 words, or about two to three 3d-printed save icons worth of text). Input
tokens are usually a lot cheaper than output tokens, but most of the time people
focus on the output token cost because that helps you figure out the "upper
bound" on cost.

Generating one million output tokens with OpenAI's O1 model costs $60. The same
number of tokens from DeepSeek R1 costs $2.19, just 3.6% of the cost of OpenAI
O1. DeepSeek R1 doesn't have vision support, tool calling, or structured
outputs, but the cost more than makes up for it. Many applications can cope with
having to "waste output" or do more complicated filtering on the client side
because the model is just that much cheaper.

Developers have already been using DeepSeek R1 to do some pretty staggering
things such as
[porting SIMD optimizations in llama.cpp from ARM to WebAssembly](https://simonwillison.net/2025/Jan/27/llamacpp-pr/).
It really does seem to be good enough, even for some advanced/specialized use
cases.

One of its biggest advantages is that it can run on hardware that you can look
at. You don't need to own a datacenter to run a frontier model anymore. For full
precision, eliminating quantization loss on the model weights, you'd need to
re-mortgage your house (or raise a series B round) for a few spare 8xH100
servers. But you can get away with
[much less](https://unsloth.ai/blog/deepseekr1-dynamic), in practice
[a Mac Studio with 192Gi of memory is all you need](https://x.com/ggerganov/status/1884358147403571466).
I'll try running it on two A100-80Gi or H100-80Gi cards, but I'm on a work trip
and haven't had the time to try doing this yet.

The DeepSeek app works well enough on my iPhone that I have no real complaints.
Sometimes the R1 model times out and I don't get a response, but if I disable
reasoning mode then I get responses pretty quickly. It has helped me rewrite
mediocre code, do the math on how many tokens can fit on a floppy disk, and
given me some amusement
[messing around with the model in order to see the limits](https://gist.github.com/Xe/8730107f4a3f4d1d43d25933bc0c91f7).

## In summary

Overall, it's a really good model and I kinda wish I had the hardware I needed
to run it in its full form locally. It's probably the best model you can run on
local hardware today. It's not perfect, but it's way better than most of the
other models in its openness and weight class. It's available to the public
through DeepSeek's platform; and more importantly you can run it yourself should
you not want to trust DeepSeek at all.

I like it and I'm mixing it into the list of models that I use for my projects.
I would have waited to write this article until I've built some things on top of
this model, but y'all've been asking me for my takes on this **right now**, and
who am I to not give the people what they want?
