## Customization

The SEO Reviewer can be customized by modifying the analysis functions:

### Adding New SEO Rules
Edit the `performSEOAnalysis()` method to add new checks:

```javascript
// Check for specific keywords
if (!content.includes('your-important-keyword')) {
  analysis.suggestions.push('Consider including "your-important-keyword" for better targeting');
}
```

### Adding New LLM Optimizations
Edit the `performLLMOptimization()` method:

```javascript
// Check for specific AI-friendly structures
const hasStepByStep = content.toLowerCase().includes('step 1') || 
                     content.toLowerCase().includes('first,');
if (!hasStepByStep) {
  analysis.suggestions.push('Consider adding step-by-step instructions for better AI comprehension');
}
```

### Customizing Terminology Rules
Edit the `performTigrisTerminologyAnalysis()` method to add new terminology checks:

```javascript
// Add new deprecated terms
const customDeprecatedTerms = [
  { term: 'file system', preferred: 'object storage', reason: 'More accurate for cloud storage' },
  { term: 'data lake', preferred: 'object storage', reason: 'Avoid confusion with analytics platforms' }
];

// Add new preferred descriptions
const customDescriptions = [
  'enterprise-grade object storage',
  'zero-egress object storage'
];
```

## Best Practices for Technical Blogs

Based on the analysis, here are key recommendations:

### SEO Best Practices
1. **Title**: 50-60 characters, include primary keyword
2. **Description**: 150-160 characters, compelling summary
3. **Keywords**: 5-8 relevant terms, avoid keyword stuffing
4. **Content**: 500+ words, well-structured with headings
5. **Images**: Always include descriptive alt text
6. **URLs**: Clean, readable slugs with hyphens

### LLM Optimization
1. **Clear Structure**: Use question-style headings when appropriate
2. **Context**: Provide background information and explain technical terms
3. **Examples**: Include code snippets and practical examples
4. **Problem/Solution**: Structure content around clear problem-solution narratives
5. **Summary**: End with conclusions or key takeaways
6. **Technical Keywords**: Include relevant industry terminology

### Tigris Terminology Standardization
1. **Preferred Descriptions**: Use standardized descriptions for LLM consistency
   - **Primary**: "Tigris is a globally distributed, multi-cloud object storage service with built-in support for the S3 API"
   - **Short**: "A multi-cloud, S3-compatible object storage service for low latency data access anywhere"
2. **Key Value Propositions**: Highlight in titles/descriptions
   - "globally distributed"
   - "multi-cloud"
   - "low-latency" or "low latency"
   - "S3-compatible"
   - "Dynamic Data Placement"
   - "Access-Based Rebalancing"
3. **Technical Accuracy**: Use consistent terminology
   - Prefer "object storage" over "file storage" for S3 compatibility
   - Use "S3-compatible" instead of "Amazon S3 compatible"
   - Say "multi-cloud" rather than "cross-cloud"
   - Use "low-latency" instead of just "fast"
4. **Brand Consistency**: Always capitalize "Tigris" when used as product name
5. **S3 Terminology**: Use bucket/object/key consistently, avoid folder/directory

## Automated Description Generation

The SEO reviewer now includes intelligent description suggestion when meta descriptions are missing, too short, or too long:

### How It Works
- **Content Analysis**: Analyzes title, headings, and content to identify key topics
- **Context Detection**: Recognizes if the post is about Tigris, development tools, AI, etc.
- **Smart Suggestions**: Generates contextually appropriate descriptions
- **Length Optimization**: Ensures suggestions are 150-160 characters for optimal SEO

### Example Suggestions

**For Tigris-focused posts:**
```
Original: "Short description"
Suggested: "Learn how AI applications with Tigris globally distributed object storage. Complete guide with practical examples."
```

**For development tool posts:**
```
Original: "AI coding tools"
Suggested: "Build AI-powered development tools from autocomplete to autonomous agents. Evolution, best practices, and industry insights."
```

**For general technical posts:**
```
Original: "Migration guide"
Suggested: "Implement cloud migration for infrastructure. Best practices, examples, and implementation guide."
```

### Customization
The description generator considers:
- **Action Words**: "Learn how", "Build", "Optimize", "Discover" based on content type
- **Technical Terms**: AI, cloud, storage, API, etc. extracted from content
- **Tigris Value Props**: Automatically includes relevant differentiators for Tigris posts
- **Optimal Length**: Truncates intelligently at sentence boundaries

## Intelligent Tag Suggestions

The SEO reviewer now analyzes content and suggests relevant tags based on the established tag taxonomy:

### How It Works
- **Content Analysis**: Analyzes title, description, headings, and body text
- **Category Matching**: Maps content to standard blog categories
- **Consistency Checks**: Identifies inconsistent tag capitalization
- **Smart Filtering**: Only suggests tags that aren't already present

### Tag Categories

**Category Tags (Always at Top):**
- Engineering, Build with Tigris, Customers, Updates
- *These tags determine post categorization and must be first in the tag list*
- *The reviewer will never suggest moving or removing these tags*

**Core Technical Areas:**
- AI, Security, Performance, Scalability

**Technologies:**
- Python, Kubernetes, Docker, Database, Cloud

**Tigris-Specific:**
- Object Storage, Migration, Tigris

**Content Types:**
- Thought Leadership, Features, Development

**Technology-Specific:**
- elixir, lancedb, duckdb, anubis, foundationdb, mcp, datasets

### Example Suggestions

**Missing fundamental tags:**
```
No tags found. Add relevant tags for better discoverability
```

**Relevant additions:**
```
Consider adding tags: Security, Performance, Kubernetes, Docker
```

**Consistency improvements:**
```
Use "AI" instead of "ai" for consistency
```
*Note: Category tags like "Engineering" are protected and won't trigger consistency warnings*

**Category tag positioning:**
```
Category tags (Engineering, Build with Tigris, Customers, Updates) should be at the top of the tag list
```

**Deprecated tag replacement:**
```
Consider replacing "vibe-coding" with "vibe coding" for better consistency
```

### Best Practices
- **Category tags first**: Engineering, Build with Tigris, Customers, Updates must be at top
- **2-5 total tags recommended** for optimal categorization  
- **Consistent capitalization** (AI not ai, but category tags are protected)
- **Specific over general** (Docker over Cloud when specifically about containers)
- **Content-type tags** help with blog organization and discovery

## Integration with Build Process

You can integrate the SEO reviewer into your CI/CD pipeline:

### GitHub Actions Example
```yaml
- name: SEO Review
  run: npm run seo:check
```

**Alternative with detailed reporting:**
```yaml
- name: SEO Review with Report
  run: |
    npm run seo:review > seo-report.txt
    # Always show report, fail if issues found
    cat seo-report.txt
    npm run seo:check
```

### Pre-commit Hook
```bash
#!/bin/sh
# Run SEO review on modified blog posts
modified_posts=$(git diff --cached --name-only | grep "blog/.*\.mdx\?$")
if [ -n "$modified_posts" ]; then
  for post in $modified_posts; do
    echo "Reviewing $post..."
    npm run seo:review "$post"
  done
fi
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Script not finding blog posts**
- Ensure you're running from the root directory of the blog
- Check that `blog/` directory exists with subdirectories containing `index.mdx` or `index.md` files

**Frontmatter parsing errors**
- Verify YAML frontmatter is properly formatted
- Check for missing `---` delimiters
- Ensure proper indentation in YAML arrays

**Permission errors**
- Make sure the script has read permissions on blog files
- On Unix systems, you may need to make the script executable: `chmod +x seo-reviewer.js`

## Contributing

To improve the SEO Reviewer:

1. Add new analysis rules in the appropriate methods
2. Update the documentation with new features
3. Test with various blog post formats
4. Consider performance optimizations for large blog collections

## Automated Content Updates

The SEO reviewer can now automatically apply certain types of suggestions directly to your blog post files using the `--apply` flag.

### What Gets Automated
